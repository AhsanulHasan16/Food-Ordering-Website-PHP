# food-ordering-website-PHP
This is my very first big project in raw PHP. It's a food ordering website. Has all the advantages and features you would expect from a food ordering website. There's also an admin panel, who are there to manage the website. 
Has login system. No normal customers can see the admin panel. 

Technologies Used in this project:

1. HTML5
2. CSS
3. Raw PHP 

The menu.php and footer.php are templates for the other pages located in the reusables folder because every pages include them. So wrote once and included in every one of the pages. These pages will be viewed by the admins who are logged in the system. Front-reusables consists of footer.php and menu.php too. But those are for the customer view. 

Though I couldn't implement a lot of security in the project because I am a fresher. But still there are some security features I implemented in this project. 

1. Passwords are all encrypted before being stored in the database. 
2. Protected from SQL Injections. 


If you want to run this on your system, you have to configure the config folder. You have to edit the confidurations in the constants.php file. That's where the database and all the connections are set. If there's any problem while configuring those, feel free to contact me.
